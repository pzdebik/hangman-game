
//INTRO
Greet our player: "Welcome to the HangMan Console Game!"
Console.WriteLine "Press ENTER to begin."
Read a text file with System.IO.File.ReadAllLines(@"path to file") and assign it to variable.
Randomly choose one string from the loaded text file  
	(this will be password that user will be looking for)
Assign chosen word to variable called "secretWord"

//IF USING USER'S INPUT
Test the word. If it has only letters return true, if not return false
	provide some explanation.
	reassign variable asking for input

Make all letters even - secretWord.ToUpper()
Convert secretWord to an char array
Create another char array which will contain chars '-' of length secretWord.
Print that array with foreach loop

Ask player for an letter
for (int i = 0; i < secretWord.Length; i++)
{
	
		if letter == secretWord[i]
		{
			hiddenChars[j] = secretArray[i]
		}
		else
		{
			hiddenChars[i] = '-';
		}
	
}

// game logic


// draw a hanged stickman -> method

// write user's achievement to a txt file (attempts and guessed letters, time )

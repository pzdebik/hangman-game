# Hangman Console Game

## How it works?
1. At the beginning, a file with a list of dozens of possible passwords (in English) is loaded and one item is selected at random.
2. The player types in the console his letter of choice.
3. When the letter is not in the obscured text, then the next part of the hangman figure is drawn.
4. When the hangman figure is fully drawn, the game ends.
5. If the player manages to win, then his score, logs of mistakes and time duration is saved to a TXT file.
